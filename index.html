            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>This project under verzeo deals with different types of Hybrid and Pure electric vehicles. I 
                completed my major project on Solar based On-road charging of Electric vehicles. In it we 
                tried to integrate solar power with On-road charging station. We rediscovered various kinds
                of losses which are associated during the wireless transmission of power between the road 
                and car. And also found necessary measures to minimize these losses as low as possible.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Underwent an internship training program at Wire Rod Mill (WRM) department in RINL, 
                Vishakhapatnam. We were asked to work under Apprentice and industry workers and know 
                about the production. The training involved practical study of DC drive control system for
                auxiliary drive motors including position control in wire rod mill. The training also involved
                understanding of new technologies opted by the RINL for efficient use of power produced 
                the plant.</p>
